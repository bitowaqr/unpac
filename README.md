### Abstract 

#### Background
The time trade-off method is widely used to elicit individual preferences over health states. The resulting utility values, measured on a scale anchored at full health (=1) and dead (=0), are commonly aggregated across individuals, in order to derive a social value set. In this paper, we argue that using dead, instead of the worst health state as a lower anchor is problematic, because individuals with a wider range of utility values have – simply for arithmetic reasons – more influence in the estimation of the social value set. 

#### Methods
Inspired by relative utilitarianism, we propose an alternative aggregation procedure, the 'UNPAc method', which aims to equalise individuals’ influences. We conducted a simulation study to demonstrate the potential impact of the new method on aggregate social health state values, and tested its practical feasibility in an EQ-5D 3L data set from the UK. 

#### Results
For the simulation study we find that, in the standard approach, an agent’s influence on the relative social value set increases linearly with their range, while in the UNPAc approach, there is practically no association between and range and influence. Both methods yield different sets of social values. When applied to the real-world EQ-5D-3L data, social value sets also differ between the two method, but, we do not find evidence for a clear, positive relationship between agents’ utility ranges and their influences.

#### Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the new relative utilitarian approach can eliminate differences in influence that are due to differences in individuals' utility ranges. However, the differences in the resulting social value may not always be considered relevant, and substantial, currently unexplained variation in individuals' influences on the social value set remain.
